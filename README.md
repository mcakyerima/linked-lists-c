## Introduction

In this section, we'll cover the basics of linked lists, including their definition, terminology, and advantages and disadvantages.

## Creating a Linked List

In this section, we'll cover how to create a linked list in C, including defining a node structure, creating a new node using `malloc()`, setting node data and pointer values, and linking nodes together to create a list.

## Traversing a Linked List

In this section, we'll cover how to traverse a linked list in C, including using a `while` loop to iterate through the list, accessing node data and pointer values, and common traversal patterns like linear search and printing.

## Inserting and Deleting Nodes

In this section, we'll cover how to insert and delete nodes in a linked list in C, including inserting a node at the beginning or end of the list, inserting a node at a specific position, and deleting a node from the beginning or end of the list or from a specific position.

## Handling Edge Cases

In this section, we'll cover how to handle edge cases when working with linked lists in C, including dealing with an empty list, inserting or deleting nodes when there's only one node in the list, and handling memory allocation errors.

## Conclusion

In this section, we'll summarize the key concepts covered in this tutorial, discuss common use cases for linked lists, and suggest other data structures to explore.
