# Linked List in C 🚀

This repository contains code examples and resources for learning about linked lists in C.

## Linked List
Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science that are commonly used in many programming applications. They are particularly useful when you need to frequently add or remove elements from a list, as they allow for efficient memory allocation and deallocation.

## Introduction

In this section, we'll cover the basics of linked lists, including their definition, terminology, and advantages and disadvantages.

## Creating a Linked List

In this section, we'll cover how to create a linked list in C, including defining a node structure, creating a new node using `malloc()`, setting node data and pointer values, and linking nodes together to create a list.

## Traversing a Linked List

In this section, we'll cover how to traverse a linked list in C, including using a `while` loop to iterate through the list, accessing node data and pointer values, and common traversal patterns like linear search and printing.

## Inserting and Deleting Nodes

In this section, we'll cover how to insert and delete nodes in a linked list in C, including inserting a node at the beginning or end of the list, inserting a node at a specific position, and deleting a node from the beginning or end of the list or from a specific position.

## Handling Edge Cases

In this section, we'll cover how to handle edge cases when working with linked lists in C, including dealing with an empty list, inserting or deleting nodes when there's only one node in the list, and handling memory allocation errors.



## Terminology

Here are some basic terms you should be familiar with when working with linked lists:

- :brain: **Node**: an element in the linked list that contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node in the list.
- :point_right: **Pointer**: a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- :first_place_medal: **Head**: the first node in the list.
- :last_place_medal: **Tail**: the last node in the list (or NULL if the list is empty).
- :x: **NULL**: a special value used in C to indicate the absence of a valid memory address.

## Exercises

In the `exercises/` directory, you'll find several C files that contain starter code for implementing linked list functions. Each file corresponds to a different exercise:

1. `01_create_linked_list.c`: Implement a function to create a linked list with a specified number of nodes.
2. `02_traverse_linked_list.c`: Implement a function to traverse a linked list and print out the data in each node.
3. `03_insert_node.c`: Implement functions to insert a node at the beginning, end, and a specific position of a linked list.
4. `04_delete_node.c`: Implement functions to delete a node from the beginning, end, and a specific position of a linked list.
5. `05_handling_edge_cases.c`: Implement error handling for edge cases, such as inserting or deleting nodes from an empty list or a list with only one node.

Each exercise file contains comments outlining the exercise prompt, as well as any provided starter code or function signatures.


## Conclusion

In this section, we'll summarize the key concepts covered in this tutorial, discuss common use cases for linked lists, and suggest other data structures to explore.
